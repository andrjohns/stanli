## 0.2.1

- The sampler draws from CmdStan's generator now. It built
  `boost::ecuyer1988` from the seed while CmdStan builds
  `boost::random::mixmax` as `(0, 1, seed, chain)`, so the same seed
  named unrelated streams and any sampling comparison was comparing two
  different draws as much as two engines. `run_nuts` calls
  `stan::services::util::create_rng` and draws the initial point the way
  `stan::io::random_var_context` does. Note that a given seed now
  produces different draws than 0.2.0 did; any seed is as valid as any
  other, but a run pinned to a seed will not reproduce byte for byte.

- A draw whose generated quantities throw is written as nan and sampling
  continues, which is what CmdStan does. `stanli_run` used to abort and
  print nothing, so one bad `lognormal_rng` on a marginal ODE solution
  discarded every draw of an otherwise good chain.

- Two kernels stopped doing twice the work. `normal_id_glm_lpdf` built a
  var tape in the forward, threw it away, and built it again in the
  backward to differentiate it; it now differentiates once and stashes
  the partials, as every other native kernel does. `OP_MATVEC`
  accumulated each output element in a single dependency chain, running
  at one multiply-add per cycle; four independent accumulators per sweep
  fill the pipeline. Both are bitwise unchanged.

      diamonds  65,799 -> 35,358 ns/grad   0.48x of CmdStan -> 0.89x
      prophet  103,452 -> 56,912 ns/grad   0.67x -> 1.23x
      blr          877 -> 709 ns/grad      1.97x -> 2.44x

  Their sampling runs followed: diamonds 108 s -> 58 s, prophet 175 s ->
  98 s. Corpus median per-gradient 2.00x -> 2.07x, 93 of 119 models at
  parity or better.

- Both changes came from profiling every sub-parity model with
  `STANLI_PROFILE=1` rather than from guessing, and the same survey says
  where the rest of the tail is: in seven of those models a single
  precompiled kernel is half to nine-tenths of the gradient. Measured
  and rejected along the way: Eigen's gemv (fastest, but reassociates
  and costs 1-2 ULP against stan-math on every model with a matrix),
  cache-blocking the accumulator, swapping the loop nesting (both
  slower than what they replaced), and the same partial-stashing on
  `multi_normal_cholesky_lpdf` (a wash, and it would have cost n^2
  doubles of scratch per op).

## 0.2.0

- Generated quantities and transformed parameters now come out of all
  119 compiling corpus models, up from 93. Where the write_array graph
  cannot express the section (RNG draws, integer draws that then size or
  index things, branches on draw-computed values), a per-draw
  interpreter runs the whole section instead: constrained parameters
  feed in by name, RNG calls draw from a seeded stream through
  stan-math, and `integrate_ode` inside generated quantities works. The
  graph stays the fast path and the sampler is untouched.
- Parameter-dependent branches compile. `if (theta > 0)` and
  `theta > 0 ? a : b` in the model block were compile errors, since an
  op graph cannot pick an arm at evaluation time. The conditional
  region now compiles to a small register program run by one op; its
  backward replays under nested autodiff, evaluating exactly the arm
  CmdStan's generated C++ would.
- The differential corpus oracle runs in CI on every push, on all four
  platforms: recorded CmdStan values for the log density and every
  gradient component replay against each build (measured worst
  deviation 2.6e-12 against a 1e-9 gate). write_array values joined the
  oracle for the 20 models whose generated quantities are
  deterministic. Recording them caught and fixed two interpreter bugs:
  uninitialized reals are NaN as in CmdStan, and batched simplex
  parameters were read transposed.
- Faster: kernel contexts and dispatch resolve once at bind time, the
  executor sweeps unroll 4x, mixture lanes fuse into batched
  elementwise-density and log_mix kernels, and element-store runs fuse
  into vector stores. Median per-gradient 2.00x CmdStan across the
  corpus, 92 of 119 models at parity or better; the ten benchmark
  models span 1.0x-6.1x, and `low_dim_gauss_mix` (0.53x in 0.1.0) is
  now 1.11x. Re-roll's write-fusion renames lazily, fixing a
  compile-time blowup on models that refill one small vector tens of
  thousands of times.
- Initialization draws that produce a non-finite log density are
  rejected and retried, as CmdStan does.
- One MIR interpreter serves transformed data, ODE right-hand sides,
  and interpreted generated quantities with one shared vocabulary, and
  the ODE register machine and the tape-island program are one machine
  with one instruction set.
- Python: `Model.log_prob_grad` raises on a failed evaluation instead
  of returning an uninitialized gradient buffer, and rejects
  wrong-sized points with `ValueError`.
- Tools: per-opcode profiling behind `STANLI_PROFILE=1`, a
  sampler-level differential harness (`tools/sampler_trace.py`), a
  contributor map in `docs/hacking.md`, and doc numbers generated from
  the measured artifacts and checked in CI.

Still true from 0.1.0: `sample()` in Python returns declared parameters
only; transformed parameters and generated quantities reach the CSV of
`stanli_run` but not the Python API yet. No variational inference, no
optimization, no multi-chain threading, no Windows wheel.

## 0.1.0

First public release.

- Stan models compiled and sampled with no C++ toolchain on the machine:
  the real stanc3 is linked into the shared library, models lower to an op
  graph over precompiled stan-math kernels, and the graph doubles as the
  autodiff tape.
- NUTS with diagonal-metric adaptation (`stan::mcmc::adapt_diag_e_nuts`),
  at CmdStan's max tree depth of 10.
- 118 of 120 posteriordb models differentially verified against CmdStan on
  the log density and every gradient component; 45 bitwise identical,
  worst deviation 2.6e-12 relative.
- Per-gradient latency 1.1x to 6.2x faster than CmdStan on nine of the ten
  benchmark models, 0.53x on `low_dim_gauss_mix`. Time to first draw
  roughly 20x faster, since there is no compile step.
- Graph passes: loop re-rolling turns unrolled per-observation loops back
  into vectorized ops (`radon_pooled` goes from 27,670 ops to 8),
  destructive functional updates, store-to-load forwarding, dead-write
  sweeping, and constant folding of the ops no parameter reaches.
  `STANLI_NO_REROLL=1` disables re-rolling.
- ODE right-hand sides compile to a flat register machine instead of being
  walked as a tree, and one solve produces both values and sensitivities:
  29x to 39x on the models that integrate. `STANLI_DEBUG_ODE=1` reports
  when a right-hand side falls back to the interpreter.
- Transformed parameters and generated quantities are computed by a
  second forward-only graph and written by the command line tool for 93 of
  the 119 compiling corpus models.
- Wheels for macOS arm64 and x86_64, Linux x86_64 and aarch64
  (manylinux_2_28). 13.8 MB installed.

Known gaps in the Python API: `sample()` returns declared parameters only,
so transformed parameters and generated quantities are not surfaced yet.
No variational inference, no optimization, no multi-chain threading, no
convergence diagnostics, no Windows wheel.
